It's a small console tool that I wrote to while long winter nights away but mostly to get acquainted with JetBrains Rider.

While the only reason for it to exist is that I wanted to develop an actual project with Rider, it's still functional so if a personal-budgeting-toolpocalypse ever happens, humanity will have something to fall back on in those trying times. It won't be pretty, but we'll overcome.
